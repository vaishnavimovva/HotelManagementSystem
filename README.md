# HotelManagementSystem 🏨
A simple management system which uses C++ concepts like Classes and File inheritance
This  offers a number of choices, like reserving a room, reviewing customer information, changing or removing any client, and seeing all rooms that have been assigned. 
The services provided by the system after updating all the rooms present in the hotel are:
 Available rooms,

 Guest Summary report. 
So, The main objective of this project “Hotel Management System” is to create a reliable and efficient system to maintain and manage a hotel from the administrative side.
